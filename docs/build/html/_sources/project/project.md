# Critical Preliminaries

The foci of critical preliminaries are:

<ul>
<li>The Problem Statement
    <ul><li>The problem and why is it important to solve.</li></ul></li>
<li>The Outcome Expectations & Underlying Aims
    <ul><li>The potential product's outcome expectations, i.e., what the future impact expectations are.</li>
        <li>Hence, the underlying aims.</li></ul></li>
<li>The Deployment Goal
    <ul><li>The expected output of the product's model.</li>
        <li>The integration of the model's output into everyday operations and interactions; comprehensible, transparent, and continuously auditable integration.</li></ul></li>
</ul>

Note, the deployment goal is about integrating a machine learning model's output into a business product, and hence business operations; it is not machine learning.
