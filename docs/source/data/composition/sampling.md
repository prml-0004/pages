# Is the data set a sample of a larger data set?

**If yes:**

<ul class="disc">
    <li class="disc"><b>If the data set is representative</b> of a larger data set: How was representativeness verified/validated?</li>
    <li class="disc"><b>If the data set is not representative</b> of the larger data set, e.g., is a geographically focused subset, explain why.</li>
</ul>
