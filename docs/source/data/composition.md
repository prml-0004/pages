In general, the questions herein should be studied before data collection.  The datasheets paper [1] notes that most of the questions:

<blockquote>
  "… are intended to provide dataset consumers with the information they need to make informed decisions about using the dataset for their chosen tasks. … the questions are designed to elicit information about compliance with the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or comparable regulations in other jurisdictions."
